## N-body Simulation

An exploration of n-body simulations and related algorithms. I started this repository a little under a year ago (as of `02/01/2025`), and I feel I implemented some interesting algorithms and even came up with my own continuous time collision detection algorithm. However I never documented it, but now I am looking to apply for masters I have a good incentive to do so :grin:. 

So the I will start documenting, cleaning up and maybe even extending the code. A list of things I am aiming to do and their progress can be found in the To-do section.

### To-Do

1. Documentation
   1. fix makefile and document how to run code
   2. document general code structure
   3. document different collision detection algorithms
   4. explain integer based arithmetic midpoint circle algorithm, and how it can be derived
   5. discuss time complexity and efficiency of all parts of code
2. Clean up code
   1. better inline documentation
   2. refactor some complex structures
3. Features
   1. QoL
      1. adjustable window size
      2. better/adjustable system initialization
   2. Optimizations
      1. implement Barnes-Hut algorithm
      2. allow for different collision detection algorithms to be used
   3. Other
      1. formally proven haskell functions core algorithms
