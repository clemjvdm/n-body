## N-body Simulation

### Criterion

##### GUI

\> can display dynamic system of particles of varying masses

\> can be used to to create and reset system of particles according to parameters

\> can be used to set scalable set of simulation parameters

##### Engine

\> can run an exact N-body simulation

\> can run a Barnes-Hut approximation for an N-body simulation

\> can export simulation data to csv


### Going Forward

\> formal validation for n-body functions
\> random momentum, mass and radius when initializing particles?
\> bh
